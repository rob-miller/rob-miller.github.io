<p>

this page documents some work I've done on
modifying hp ink cartridges to improve their 'refillability'.  I have
a photosmart 8450 and a deskjet 1220C, but this work is focused on the
newer style cartridges for the 8450 (specifically the 100, 344, and
348 but probably relevant to most of this style).  this work is
probably only for the hardcore home-refilling geek, but certainly it
would be interesting to hear from anyone selling specially modified hp
ink carts!
<p>
I have a love-hate relationship with the hp printers.  I really like
their support of open-source drivers for linux, and this was probably
the deciding factor in buying another (third) hp printer instead of a
canon - even though my 960 died for no apparent reason.
presumably hp wouldn't be too enamoured of me publishing this page (if
they notice) and
would just as soon I be taking away canon's ink revenue instead, but
I'm just completely fed up with the cost of the cartridges and how
quickly they run out when making full size (a4 / 8x10 ) prints.  
<p>
in fact, in my opinion the 8450 has been relatively well set up for
(home) refillers; the alignment and cartridge cleaning entries on the menu
are really helpful, and you can always buy new carts with their
integrated print heads and start over again.
<p> 
naturally, the inability to somehow tell the printer that the
cartridge really is full again is not helpful, and no I have not found
a solution.  I expect that these newer printers (compared to e.g. the
1220 or 960) keep track of the used cartridge serial numbers in
non-volatile memory with enough space for thousands of entries instead
of the three-deep queue the older models apparently have.  although
there's no block to printing, this is more than the minor annoyance of
the various warnings about carts being low on ink, as it would be nice
to have a reliable system for knowing when to refill before the print
head runs dry.
<p>
I'm very interested in the new Kodak printers recently announced, and
I hope they live up to the claims of reduced ink (and matching paper)
prices.  will just have to see how they come through on the linux
side.  although I've enjoyed the challenge of figuring out ways to
make the hp systems work better for me, I've really put a lot more
time into it than I intended to and would really prefer to have been
just putting out nice photos.  the fact of the matter is that I care
about the quality of my final product, and getting the best can easily
take more than one try.  in order to make it an enjoyable and
stress-free experience - I am the paying consumer after all - this
means I need to be working with something along the cost lines of
water (or maybe milk) instead of liquid platinum.
<p>
I would pay extra for access to bulk genuine hp ink (perhaps even
avoiding the long detour into color management and icc profiles).
I've avoided modifying hplip or developing something standalone to try
and track ink usage because I don't want to be the source of any
anti-open-source ammunition.  I am just not happy with my ability to
produce my own prints, so much so that I paid $2 a page recently for
someone else to deal with the failures when I needed it done right.
<p>
well, enough diatribe; on to the content.
<p>

<b>principles:</b>
<p>

the basic principles behind these modifications are:

<ul>
<li>
to refill before the cartridge runs dry, and thereby avoid having to re-prime
the printhead.  during refilling the printheads are closed with the
plastic from 'Universal Inkjet Cartridge Printhead Seals' obtained
from <a
href="http://www.printerfillingstation.com/Ink_Refills/accessories.htm">printerfillingstation.com</a>
to avoid contamination between ink colors.
</li>
<li>
to be able to fill the cartridge completely (there are various
reported issues about these cartridges not taking as much ink after
several refills; can confirm by weights of new and refilled cartridges)
</li>
<li>
to make the refilling as easy as possible
</li>
</ul>

the first point still takes too much diligence, and I haven't really
solved it.  I do think I've succeeded on the second and third.
<p> 

<b>approach:</b>
<p>
I added windows to the cartridges so I can observe the ink levels in
the sponges directly.  this didn't really work, as I've not been able
to adequately seal the windows over the long term.  I also drilled
separate holes for refilling, allowing access to reservoirs inside the
cartridge that aren't accessed by the normal 'needle in the sponge'
approach. 
<p>
<b>disclaimers:</b>
<ul>
<li> the tools used are dangerous; take more than appropriate
precautions if you try any of this at all and <b>use eye protection</b>
</li>
<li> you may damage your hp ink cartridge if you do any of this, and
it may not work any more and it will be your fault and your
responsibility.
</li>
<li>installing a modified cartridge may damage your printer, and
it may not work any more and it will be your fault and your
responsibility.
</li>
<li>you will get ink everywhere doing this, and it may not ever come
out and it will be your fault and your responsibility.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>tools:</b>
<p>
the main tool used for cutting and drilling on the cartridges was the
rotary tool shown in the <b>eye protection</b> photos.  known widely
as a 'dremel tool', mine is actually from sears.  getting the top off
the cartridges for initial investigations required a saw blade from x-acto.
<p>
<b>background:</b>
<p>
<img src="photos/eye_protect.jpg">
<p>
did I mention <b>use eye protection</b>?  here it is again: <b>use eye
protection</b>.  I value my eyes very highly; <b>I always use eye
protection</b>. 
<p>
<img src="photos/top.jpg">
<p>
as you can see, the top cover has grooves that the main cartridge body
slides into, and there's probably some heavy-duty glue added as well.
I don't think there's any way you would get the cover off without
cutting, as I did here.  it is unlikely the cover can be sealed back
on at this stage...
<p>
<img src="photos/inside-1.jpg">
<p>
inside a an opened and cleaned up cartridge, view number one.  not the
only photo on the web of this subject.  what a nice color the sponges
are without any ink.
<p>
<img src="photos/inside-2.jpg">
<p>
inside an opened and cleaned cartridge, view number two; a few water
drops remain.  the silver
things are the mesh forming the beginning of the print head.  ideally
from there through to the printhead will remain full of ink, never
drying out or getting any air bubbles.  note in particular the
reservoirs on each side of the top mesh, and in 'front' of the two
other meshes.  observe that the sponge compresses against the silver
mesh, leaving the indentations, but probably doesn't extend all the
way down into these reservoirs.
<p>
<b>first modification:</b>
<p>
<img src="photos/needle.jpg">
<p>
instead of
going through the ventilation holes on top of the cartridge (under the
sticker), create an access to use longer needles to reach all the way
to these reservoirs.  if long needles are used through the exiting ventilation
ports, they will puncture the mesh and probably the cartridge will not
work as intended any more.  
<p>
<img src="photos/holes.jpg">
<p>
"Intended for single use only."  there doesn't seem to be a good way
to template or otherwise plan these holes; just 'eyeball' it.  these
positions are well away from the mesh and lead directly into the
reservoirs at the bottom of the cartridge.  the pair of reservoirs on
either side of the top mesh are connected by channels, so only one
side needs to be filled.
<p>
<b>second modification:</b>
<p>
<p>
so the extra holes improve the ability to fill easily and completely
but a problem remains in determining what the ink level inside is
between refills.  to solve this, holes were cut in the sides of the
cartridge and covered with clear plastic (from cd envelopes).  the
plastic was glued down with epoxy.
<p>
<img src="photos/window-1.jpg">
<p>
<img src="photos/window-2.jpg">
<p>
<img src="photos/window-3.jpg">
<p>
that's just a bit of clear sticky tape covering the hole in the last
photo; it didn't seal very well.  if doing this again, the holes don't
need to go nearly as close to the top as shown in the first images,
and leaving extra surface intact as in the third image makes sealing
easier. 
<p>
<b>results:</b>
<p>
over time, the epoxy could not withstand exposure to the (liquid?)
ink.  other adhesives are under investigation.  the photos below are
after approximately eight months.
<p>
<img src="photos/window-later-1.jpg">
<p>
in this photo the epoxy is failing in both windows, although one has
only a relatively small leak
<p>
<img src="photos/window-later-2.jpg">
<p>
in this photo one window has remained sealed, whilst the other has
experienced catastrophic failure. although not shown, the side windows
remained sealed on all three cartridges.
<p>
<b>conclusions:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
drilling the holes seems like a useful idea, and will try this again
in the next set of cartridges.  by filling this way the sponge can be
completely soaked (the refilled weight reaches or exceeds that of the
new cartridge), whereas filling through the ventilation ports is
apparently not as efficient.
</li>
<li>
the windows ultimately failed, at least with the adhesive tried so far
</li>
<li>
the cartridge has to be removed to view the windows, but with
experience one can tell by weight how full the cartridges are at this
point anyway
</li>
<li>
the windows would still be useful in the filling process, as
overfilling through the holes could easily lead to contamination
between colors.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I hope you have found this useful or perhaps just interesting.  please
drop me a line if you have some information or ideas to contribute.
