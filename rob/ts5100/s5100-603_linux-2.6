I have the S5100-603 which is exactely the same than yours except for having a 
1.9 Ghz cpu and a 60 GB harddisk.

Well, so far I tested 2.6.0-test9 to 2.6.1
(I use Gentoo linux-2.6.1-rc2-gentoo)

But I have several problems.

No problems compiling the kernel. Just take care not to use the floppy!
Framebuffer, ide (use boot param idebus=66 to speed it up a bit), ethernet, 
usb, cf, vmware, and Nvidia works perfect.
acpi works, and the toshiba-acpi too.

A very nice feature is the cpu clocking feature
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/
a brief description can be found in 
/usr/src/linux-2.6.1-rc2-gentoo/Documentation/cpu-freq/user-guide.txt
U can set the frequency to any of the following frequences:
237500 475000 712500 950000 1187500 1425000 1662500 1900000 Hz
This saves a lot of battery power


But
Suspend:
software suspend:  chrashes while suspending or simply does not wake up 
suspend to disk: sometimes works sometimes not.. Without X it seems to be more 
stable, but not reliable.
Suspend to ram does nothing at all

Firewire:
I use a external harddisk for backup and hd space extension which has USB and 
Firewire.
Unfortunately the Toshiba has only USB 1.1 which is far too slow.
So I wanted to use IEEE1394.
But after (sucessfull) loading ohci1394 the system runs into troubles, even if 
you don't use it. 
I get the same errors as described here:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=716867&group_id=2252&atid=202252

Sound:
The deprecated OSS drivers work fine but Alsa makes troubles
I simply get distorting sound with clicks and speed problems. Depending on the 
system load it sounds like a old tape recorder with speed problems.
The kernel reports 
ALSA sound/core/pcm_lib.c:224: Unexpected hw_pointer value [2] (stream = 0, 
delta: -1566, max jitter = 8192): wrong interrupt acknowledge?
about once a minute. The delta differs between -62 and -2046

It seems to be a interrupt problem, but I have no idea how to change the 
interrupt of the soundcard


Bluetooth:
The hci_uart loads but it seems that it does not work.
In the moment I don't have any Bluetooth devices so I can't test

IRDA:
Not tested so far

Modem:
not tested so far

Cpad:
I use a USB-mouse.
So I did not test it so far. 
But with 2.4.x I was using the LCD for monitoring the net load, the system 
load and the battery power.
And of course I want to use that feature with 2.6 too.
But I did not have time so far.

WiFI:
I have the original internal Thosiba pccard.
Works fine with orinoco hermes and orinoco_cs
cardmgr loads the automatically
But I just played arround a bit with it, so I don't know how stable it is

SD & SM
No way to get it working so far, but I also did not try very hard

Some more comments:
There is a new Bios available, v 1.20 but for Linux I can not see any 
differences
Oh, and one more thing:
If u want to reset the bios to the defaults, power on the system, immediately 
press ESC and then F1


cheers
