Views of the problem.  This noise appears at random times on the
screen, sometimes I can cause it by tapping around the case or
typing.  With the nv driver the event may crash X, and with the Nvidia
driver it happens less often but can kill Linux.
<p>

<p>
I advise you not to do anything you see on this page,
<em>especially</em> if you don't know how to handle these items.
<p>
<img src = "scratches.jpg">
<p>
Do as I say, not as I did.  Put something soft under the top of the
case before you go working on the bottom screws.
<p>
<img src = "button-bezel.jpg">
<p>
On the top side, this plate surrounding the power and other custom
buttons comes off and reveals screws holding down the keyboard.
<p>
<img src = "arrange-screws-2.jpg">
<p>
My advice is to place the screws in a pattern reflecting the way they
come out.  These are the keyboard screws and five from more underneath
the keyboard holding the case.
<p>
<img src = "screen-disassembly.jpg">
<p>
The bezel in front of the display is held down by two screws above the
keyboard on each side of the Toshiba logo (behind black stickers).  Only
remove the three screws on each side of the display (underneath blue
stickers) if you want to get the LCD panel to be free as shown here.
<p>
<img src = "under-screen-bezel.jpg">
<p>
This is about all there is to see behind the screen bezel,
though. There's no separate cover 
in front of the LCD, so all those marks are there to stay.  I put
a plastic sheet (a.k.a. "screen condom") over the screen (after this
photo), but the bubbles still haven't worked out.
<p>
<b>The hidden screws on the bottom case</b>
<p>
There's one under the hard drive cover, but that's easy.
<p>
<img src = "under_battery.jpg">
<p>
There's a small one under the battery - I think it's just there to
make sure you don't  forget and leave the battery in during
disassembly.
<p>
<img src = "under-rj45.jpg">
<p>
Here's the other one, under the RJ-45 and RJ-11 sockets.  What goes in
that big empty space, and where can I get one?  Is it supposed to be the wireless card?  I only
have Bluetooth.
<p>
<img src = "arrange-screws.jpg">
<p>
Again, you will want to arrange the screws carefully as they come out
(unless you're not planning to re-assemble!)
<p>
<img src = "under-case.jpg">
<p>
After that it's all pretty straightforward, if you're used to this
kind of work.  The video card is on the left (includes the external
monitor plug).
<p>
<img src = "vidcard-top.jpg">
<p>
Here's the video card I'd like to replace, top view...
<p>
<img src = "vidcard-bottom.jpg">
<p>
... bottom view.
<p>
<p>
In the end I managed some improvement by cleaning the contacts on the
video card, re-seating it, and putting the screws back tighter than
they had been before.  Even better results came from switching back to
the proprietary Nvidia X drivers, but that doesn't help on the frame
buffer, console, boot disks, etc.
