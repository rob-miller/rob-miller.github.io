<li> <b>Fix your own video problems!</b> Pete has contacted me and
described how he used a generic heat gun to re-flow the solder under
the components on the circuit boards of his failing laptop.  Not for
the faint-of-heart, all risk is yours, ymmv, etc. etc. but here's his
<a href="pete.txt">story</a>.  Drop me a line if you try this and it
works for you too.
</li>
<li> I am pleased to report some <b>good news</b> for me, I was able to get my
motherboard repaired by Robert at <a
href="http://www.fixmytoshibalaptop.com/">www.fixmytoshibalaptop.com</a>.
I definitely recommend him in a big way.  Clearly I've changed my mind
about the laptop being worth investing more money in, especially when
I saw how much new UXGA laptops cost.  I guess now I have to get these
pages up to date!
</li>
<li> Hardware problems with your satellite 510x, especially video
card?  Join in the push for a class action lawsuit : check out the
message board <a href="http://groups.msn.com/TOSHIBA5105DISPLAYPROBLEM">here</a> and/or

</li> 
<li> December 2005: I was having some problems with my power supply,
having to bang it on hard surfaces to get it working.  Ordered a
replacement off eBay, but shortly before I got it I did the
'banging' trick with the old one and left it charging the battery.
Noticed the power light slowly cycling on and off, thought it would be
best to just unplug it.  That was in August, just before we left
London for Lusaka, and I haven't seen the laptop power on since.  If
you find yourself with video card problems like mine (below), my
advice is to not put any money into the laptop as it has probably
reached the end of its useful life. </li>

<li> June 2005: I've been having some problems with my video card.  Here's a new
page on <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/disassembly/index.shtml">Disassembling the Toshiba
Satellite 5100-501</a>, but I didn't have much luck fixing it.  It would seem to
be poor hardware design, resulting in overheating of the video chips;
checkout <a href="http://www.notebookforums.com/showthread.php?t=48948&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15">this
link</a> for grumpy windows users in the same boat.  I did get a
replacement video card for �293 including VAT from Gultronics in London (Tottenham
Court Rd), but don't know what the person who walked out of the shop
with it said to them to avoid bringing the laptop in.
</li>

<li> Another <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/ryan-hope.msg2">submission</a> from Ryan Hope,
here's 
<ul>
<li> a <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/cpad-2.6_v1.1.patch.bz2">patch</a> to put cpad
directly into the kernel (not a module)</li>
<li> a <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/toshiba_fixes.patch.bz2">combo patch</a> containing
the Toshiba ACPI patch plus bluetooth mods, the smbus fix and the
firewire fix.</li>
<li> a <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/orinoco-0.15rc2.patch.bz2">patch</a> for the internal
Orinoco wireless card.  This updates the in kernel version so scanning
works. </li>
</ul>
Ryan sent those to me in late February, sorry I've been so slow in the
updates!!!! </li>

<li> Peter Zberg wrote to say he got 1600x1200 working (as opposed to
1588x1200) with the Nvidia accelerated drivers using info from a
<a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/history/312349">thread</a>
at linuxquestions.org regarding similar problems on a 5105-s701.  The
key posting is mirrored <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/nv_xorg.conf_frag">here</a>. I went
ahead and put the same sync freqs and modeline in my xorg.conf
file, looks more appropriate and works fine; hmmm, perhaps I'll go
back and try Nvidia drivers again, I've heard they support suspending
now....</li>  


<li> Update on the <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/tosh-1394.patch">Firewire / IEEE1394
patch</a> submitted by Oliver K.  (The patch linked is for a
2.6.11-rc3 kernel, but the code in this section doesn't seem to have
changed much in a while).  I had hoped to get this into the kernel,
but the cognescenti tell me that it should more correctly be in as a
'pci quirk'.  I haven't had time or learning how to do that yet, so
here is where it stands for now.  As always, any submissions will be
welcome! 
</li>

<li> got the in-kernel swsusp working with 2.6.11-rc2, using the
hibernate script file from 
<a href="http://softwaresuspend.berlios.de/">berlios</a> and the
"UseACPISleep 4b" method (echo 4b &gt; /proc/acpi/sleep).  My
hibernate.conf is somewhat gentoo specific, but 
<a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/hibernate.conf">here</a> it is. </li>

<li> Ryan Hope <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/ryan-hope.msg">contributes</a>
  <ul>
  <li> this <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/toshiba_enable_SMBus.patch">patch</a> for
  drivers/pci/quirks.c to enable the SMBus so you can use lm_sensors!
  After patching, you need to compile modules for 'I2C support', 'I2C
  device interface', 'Intel 801' under I2C Hardware Bus support, 'Nat
  Semi LM90 and compatibles' under 'Hardware Sensors Chip support',
  and 'EEPROM reader' if you want it under 'Other I2C Chip
  support'. </li>
  <li> another modeline for the current Nvidia drivers with
  Xorg/Xfree, best he can get (even with ignoreEDID and NVreg_Mobile)
  is: 
<pre>Modeline "1588x1200" 162 1588 1664 1856 2160 1200 1201 1204 125
</pre>
Thanks Ryan!
</li>
  </ul>
</li><li> Oliver Koenig comes through again, <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/1394.msg">here</a>'s 
his report on getting firewire (ieee1394) working on the 5100.  I put
the patch into my 2.6.10 kernel, but haven't tried it as I need to
get a 6-pin to 4-pin firewire adapter before I can play with my new
external drive (the old 40G internal) at full speed.  Thanks Oliver!</li>

<li> a little update since someone asked in e-mail, despite any words to
the contrary below in this needs-to-be-rewritten page, I curently (Jan
2005) run Gentoo Linux with a 2.6 kernel and Xorg.  I recently upgraded to an
80G drive, at that point I dumped my Windows partition entirely -- just 
never got used so why waste the space? </li>

<li> Got my screen replaced under the 3-year warranty due to the
'washed out pixels'.  No hassles, looks great, shiny spot is gone too.</li>

<li> <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/xf86-concurrent">Here</a>'s a report on getting
concurrent LCD and TV-out working from Oliver Koenig</li>

<li> The Winmodem works (!!!) with the SmartLink drivers from <a href="http://www.smlink.com">www.smlink.com</a>.</li>

<li> Tom Lukasiak got the 1600x1200x16 framebuffer working!  Tiny-font
fiends (like me!) rejoice! The magic
incantation is vga=0x346 in your lilo.conf (grub users adjust
appropriately).</li>

<li> Jan Steinhoff has re-written the cPad driver for kernel 2.6!
Proper framebuffer device support, works with the XFree86 Synaptics
Touchpad driver, and images sent in a single URB.  Works great but I
still haven't switched to 2.6 full time because swsusp hasn't been
there yet.  Check it out at <a href="http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/%7Ep1stja/linux/cpad.html">Jan's

This <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/t5105.pdf">document</a> from Toshiba describes the overall specification of the 5105-S607, which I believe
to be the US version of the 5100-501 (without Bluetooth or the <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/laptop_choices.html">'Treasure Island'</a> price).

Note that the IDE controller is <b>not</b> actually the Intel PIIX4 as selected in the kernel config, but it is recognised
as ICH3M (82801CAM) during boot.
</p><p>
The main points of interest for me are:
</p><ul>
<li> Pentium 4, 1.7Ghz, 512mb SDRAM</li>
<li> 1600x1200 (UXGA) display, Nvidia NV17 GeForce4 440 Go controller with 32mb DDR RAM</li>

</p><p>(update 15 April 03) 

</p><p>I currently use^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H was using the UXGA (1600x1200) server option for this system from 
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html">Nvidia</a>.  The drawbacks are that this 'taints'
the kernel with a non-GPL module, that -currently- there is no power management support 
(so suspend/resume breaks right here), and that it won't work with the 2.5 kernels by default.  On the positive side, 
TwinView (for TV and RGB output with X windows) and the framebuffer interaction works, plus it's fast and pretty.
</p>
<p> There are patches available to make this work on 2.5, I used them successfully during my SWSUSP odyssey.  Check out the 
<a href="http://www.minion.de/nvidia.html">minion</a> and/or <a href="http://mirror.devolus.org/gentoo-portage/media-video/nvidia-kernel/files/">devolus</a> sites.
</p><p>
Here's my <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/XF86Config-4nv">NVidia XF86Config-4</a> file.  In addition to the more technical features, I've
set the 'NoLogo' option to skip the Nvidia splash screen and set 'DigitalVibrance' to 2 (range is 0-4).  
Check out the Nvidia README to learn more options.
</p><p>
On some variations of this laptop users have reported to me some problems under X.  Alan Danziger (Toshiba 5105-S901) needed
</p><pre>Options "IgnoreEdid"  "true"
</pre>
<br>
in the XF86Config-4 file, while Steve Dean (Toshiba 6100) reported a
black line on the right side of the display, and worked out that he
needed to modify os-registry.c in the
Nvidia kernel driver to have
<br>
<br>
<pre> Vreg_SoftEDIDs = 0 (disable checking - default was 1)
 NVreg_Mobile = 2 (non-Compal Toshiba - default was ~0)
</pre>
<br>
in order to get the full 1600x1200.
<br>
<br>
Your mileage may vary.
<p></p><p>
<b>TV out:</b> The config file above is set up to display on both the TV and LCD panel at 800x600 when/if
you (re)start the X server with the TV output connected.  TV sound works as well.  J. Belmonte's work (toshiba_acpi module)
supports TV out as a video option through the /proc/acpi/toshiba interface.  Note, the toshiba_acpi code will let you
put a console on the TV screen (hmmm, haven't tried with SVGAlib yet) without a reboot, but putting X on the TV always 
seems to require re-starting the X server.
</p><p>
<b>Update:</b> Oliver Koenig wrote me with an XF86Config-4 file that
activates both the LCD and TV-out whether the TV is connected or not.
Don't know if the Nvidia chip is happy about this but it's probably ok
since X lets you do it...  The magic lines are
</p><pre>  Option       "MetaModes"                "1024x768, 1600x1200; NULL,1600x1200"
  Option       "ConnectedMonitor"         "TV, DFP"
</pre>
and <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/xf86-concurrent">here</a>'s his report.

<p></p><p>
<b>RGB out:</b> RGB output is a little trickier (or really simple -- just reboot with the monitor plugged in).  
To have software control, you need to install John Belmonte's 
<a href="http://memebeam.org/toys/ToshibaAcpiDriver">Toshiba Extras</a> ACPI module kernel patch.  Switching 
puts the console on the external monitor as well 
as the X server, however the default setup above has TwinView using 800x600 when enabled.  To get the full 
resolution, you need to select the second ServerLayout by starting with "startx -- -layout CRT".  You can switch 
the XF86Config-4 file ServerLayout sections around so that the RGB TwinView is the default rather than the TV support 
and thus use xdm, but that's left as an exercise to the reader (see the comments in the file).  As noted on J.
Belmonte's pages, you should go to the console, switch LCD/CRT, and then go back to X.  Sometimes doing this I get
to a state where the LCD panel can't sync on the console framebuffer, but no big deal as the external monitor is there
after all.
</p><p>
<b>Framebuffer:</b> Compile the VESA framebuffer into the kernel (I
also like the 8x8 compiled-in font myself), and put vga=0x31a
(1280x1024 at 16 bits color) or vga=0x346 for 1600x1200x16 (thanks Tom
Lukasiak and <a href="http://portal.suse.com/sdb/en/2001/05/wessels_easy_fbdev.html">a
SUSE web page</a>).
into your <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/lilo.conf">lilo.conf</a>.  See the 
<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Framebuffer-HOWTO.html">framebuffer howto</a>.  You may need to convert that to a decimal value for older lilo's.  
I think you also need the <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/XF86Config-4x">XF86Config-4</a> file's Frame Buffer section in order to 
switch between X and the console.  No, TV out (at least to my TV :-) won't handle the 1280x1024 framebuffer, I just go 
back to vga=extended.
</p><p>
Extra thanks to macemoneta on the <a href="http://forums.compuserve.com/vlforums/default.asp?SRV=Toshiba&amp;loc=us&amp;access=public">Compuserve Toshiba list</a> for supplying his XF86Config-4 file, which was the basis 
for most of this.
</p><p>
If you do need to switch around between console and X while using the CRT or TV out, my findings are that you need 
to re-start X with the alternate video already plugged in.  Presumably this is because the Nvidia driver will be accessing the
graphics chip directly, independent of the Toshiba BIOS (HCI) commands used by the /proc/acpi interface.
</p><p>
The <b>update</b> bit is mostly covered under SWSUSP in the <a href="#acpi">acpi</a>
section. Mainly I am happily running the XFree86 4.3 X server, though
most of my X software is still 4.1, and it wasn't too painful a
download. No, the TV and CRT out are not working at all yet for this
server...
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><a name="kbdmouse"></a><b><font size="+2">Keyboard &amp; Mouse</font></b>
</p><p>
There's an annoying key repeat problem under X windows, my solution is to use 'xkbset' as well as a 
special keymap (Xmodmap) to enable the 'windows' and 'menu' keys for use as extra mousebuttons.  
<a href="http://rooster.stanford.edu/%7Eben/toshiba/keyboard.php">Ben Lynn's site</a> explains that the spurious keypresses
have the characteristic that the keyrelease is <b>immediate</b>, thus we can use an XKB preference called 'SlowKeys' to 
allow only keypresses that last a minimum length of time.  Another XKB preference disables the bell that this setting
enables.  Next, one requires software to work with the XKB API and manage these features; I use 
<a href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/%7Estephen/software/#xkbset">xkbset</a>
by Stephen Montgomery-Smith (also in <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/xkbset.html">Debian unstable</a>).
Under Debian, I place this <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/40custom-rtm">script</a> in /etc/X11/Xsession.d to implement the key fix for 
all users (and - I think - the xdm login) as well as load my <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/Xmodmap">Xmodmap</a> file.  There are several
other fixes for this problem around the net.
</p><p> 
The mouse is USB, thus the 'USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support' is recommended, and see the 
<a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/XF86Config-4x">XF86Config-4</a> file for the protocol.  I haven't made any effort to set up gpm thus far.
</p><p>
If you load my <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/cPad">cPad</a> driver module, you can get the middle mouse button working (and won't need 
the hid module above).  See
<a href="http://memebeam.org/toys/ToshibaAcpiDriver">John Belmonte's</a> toshiba_acpi work to use/access the 'Toshiba' 
and 'internet' buttons next to the power button.

<p><a name="sound"></a><b><font size="+2">Sound</font></b>
</p><p>Sound options are either the i810 code that comes with the kernel distribution, or the Advanced Linux 
Sound Architecture (<a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a>) software distribution.  Here's some random
hints which may be useful either way:
</p><ul>
<li>The <a href="http://xine.sourceforge.net/">Xine</a> DVD player works with 
both ALSA and the kernel's OSS i810 driver (thanks Sean Neakums)</li>
<li>I've read that you need the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi">ACPI</a> patch to get sound working on
this system -- I can't confirm that, but I do use the patch.</li>
<li>On at least two occasions I achieved a state in which sound was not working and then began to work after booting
into WindowsXP.  One of these was after the battery had run down completely.  Possibly WXP initialises something that
the Linux side does not, however I've not seen this happen for some time.</li>
<li>If you build ALSA from source, the mixer levels are set to '0' and muted by default.  Run alsamixer, use the arrow keys
to adjust the levels (resolution is a function of the window you run in), use the 'm' key control muting.  Here's my 
<a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/asound.state">/etc/asound.state</a> file to try if you can't work out what needs to be enabled to get some noise out.  Don't forget there's also an 
external volume control ;-)</li>
<li>If you go with the Debian binaries, I found the default sound levels to be set too high (in the red), causing distortion.</li>
<li>If you want both the kernel and the ALSA options, modularise the
kernel drivers. You must build both 'Sound Card Support'
and 'Intel ICH (i8xx) audio support' as modules. If you don't build
'Sound card support' as a module, you'll see the error
"alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or
directory" when you try to set sound levels with alsamixer.</li>
<li>If you build ALSA from source, start with 
"<font face="Courier New,Courier">./configure  --with-sequencer=yes  --with-oss=yes --with-cards=intel8x0</font>" as suggested 
by <a href="http://www.condorito.org/Toshiba">Nicolas Beaulieu</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><a name="acpi"></a><b><font size="+2">Toshiba modules / ACPI</font></b>
</p><p> As noted above, I'm using the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi">ACPI patch</a>. The benefits are
at least some of the following:
</p><ul>
<li>ALSA (sound) works</li>
<li>pressing the 'power' button for less than 4 seconds halts the system nicely</li>
<li>/proc/acpi contains a subdirectory with CPU temperature in celsius rather than kelvin (which can be displayed on the <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/cPad">cPad</a>.</li>
</ul>
Also as noted above, I'm using John Belmonte's <a href="http://memebeam.org/toys/ToshibaAcpiDriver">Toshiba Extras</a> kernel
patch/module, which is based on the work of <a href="http://www.buzzard.org.uk/toshiba">Jonathan Buzzard</a>.  
This is now included in the ACPI patch.  The benefits here are:
<ul>
<li>fan control</li>
<li>LCD brightness control</li>
<li>enable console on external RGB monitor</li>
<li>enable console TV out</li>
<li>enable sysevent fifo to see 'toshiba' and 'internet' buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also the <a href="http://www.buzzard.org.uk/toshiba">Jonathan Buzzard</a> toshiba.o module (toshutils) already in the
kernel source tree, this will only work if you exclude <b>all</b> the ACPI code from the kernel.  In this case, load the module
with the option "tosh_fn=0x62" to get the hotkeys (function keys) working.  Alternatively, and still subject to the ACPI problem
as far as I know, try Charles Schwieters' <a href="http://www.schwieters.org/toshset/">toshset</a> utility (works without 
toshiba.o).  I have heard that the problem with ACPI is not present in the 2.5 kernels.
</p>
<p>
<b>SWSUSP:</b>
</p><p>I am successfully using the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/swsusp">SWSUSP</a> patch (also see <a href="http://fchabaud.free.fr/English/default.php3?COUNT=3&amp;FILE0=Tricks&amp;FILE1=Laptop&amp;FILE2=Swsusp">here</a>), 
a fully Linux solution for suspending to a swap partition.  This required switching to the XFree86 Xserver version 4.3, and 
I'm now on kernel 2.4.21-rc1 with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi">ACPI</a> patch.  I was having a problem
with the (non-kernel) PCMCIA code -- couldn't see the bridge after resuming -- but I have found that the kernel-PCMCIA code
does all I need now; compile the code in (not modularised), I'm only using CardBus.  There is a bug in the 
smc-ircc IrDA code, see my <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/irda.html">IrDA page</a> for the fix while I wait for it to get into the kernel.
</p><p>
There is a problem with the 2.4.20 ACPI-patched kernel, fixed in the
20030321 and later ACPI patches. The problem appears as
a general slowdown for the whole system, and if you run 'top' you'll
see 'system' getting 99-100% of the CPU with 'keventd' accumulating
loads of time. There is a "fix" (the correct term is actually "hack"
:-) that I heard of second-hand from Marco Trevisani: </p><p>

  Edit drivers/acpi/events/evrgnini.c, go to end of function
  'acpi_ev_pci_config_region_setup()' and comment out the line that
  reads
</p><p>
  acpi_os_derive_pci_id (node, region_obj-&gt;region.node, &amp;pci_id);
</p><p>
  (in the 2.4.21-pre3 is at line 274).
</p><p>
This doesn't seem like the best solution to me, but it seems to work
without any other side-effects that I've noticed. A better solution
as of today is to use kernel 2.4.21-pre5 or later; there is an ACPI
patch (without the bug) and the SWSUSP patch from &lt;
href="http://fchabaud.free.fr/English/default.php3?COUNT=3&amp;FILE0=Tricks&amp;FILE1=Laptop&amp;FILE2=Swsusp"&gt;fchabaud.free.fr
for the previous ACPI-patched kernel -almost- works (check and fix the
errors by hand when you apply the patch!).
</p><p>
I tried a <b>lot</b> of different things before I finally got this all working.  Here's the main 'gotchas':
</p><ul>
<li>
The NVidia X server (as of version 1.0-4349) won't play with SWSUSP; the module 'nvidia.o' can't be removed even after the 
server has been suspended.  I switched to the server from XFree86, version 4.3.  Debian 'stable' is currently on X 4.1, but 
I found that I only needed to get the server and a few supporting files from <a href="http://people.debian.org/%7Emmagallo/packages/xfree86/i386/">an unofficial deb site</a>
to get up and running (around 5mb through my dial-up, but I went ahead
and got about 10mb more to update the libraries and extensions). The
only initial change to my <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/XF86Config-4x">XF86Config-4</a> file was to set the 'Driver'
entry to "nv"; later I set the HWCursor to off as the mouse pointer was messed up and maybe changed a few other things.</li>
<li>
Use the 'suspend.sh' script from the SWSUSP sites, after you've run it --install it creates a 'hibernate' script which wraps
around the kernel part of SWSUSP and sorts out modules, X, and system services before the actual suspend and after the resume.
'Hibernate' uses an <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/suspend.conf">/etc/suspend.conf</a> file, you'll want to look in there for the words 'nvidia' and 'acpi' (if you use the 
ACPI-patch version) and do what it says.  Suspend.sh works out your distribution and creates 'hibernate' appropriately; for 
version 0.13 on Debian I still needed to make a few tweeks to suspend.conf.</li>
<li>Compile in the main USB code (not modularised) except for the
actual device drivers like bootp and HID (if you want to use my cPad
driver). <b>Update:</b> I'm back to modularising <em>all</em> the USB
code now, in agreement with the SWSUSP docs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think that's it, the main thing should be knowing that it <b>really does work</b> on the this laptop once you can get a
non-NVidia X solution.  Here's today's 2.4.20 kernel <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/config.2420swsusp">.config</a> file in case I missed anything.
</p><p>
(28 Apr 03) I am using the 20030328 ACPI patch with the swsusp-rc1-1924
and swsusp-1925-incremental patches. You need to read the mailing list
(linked off the SWSUSP FAQ page) to work out which patch goes with
which kernel, but seems reliable
for me at the moment. I did have some problems when the kernel compile
wasn't just right, e.g. having it look for ide-cd as a
module when it was compiled-in, and the 0424 ACPI patch seems to play
ok with the SWSUSP patches but the resulting kernel doesn't
suspend/resume reliably.
</p>
<p> I bought a Gig of RAM and had problems
with SWSUSP (kernel 2.4.25), had to patch the kernel to make it all appear in LOWMEM
-- see my <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=swsusp-devel&amp;m=107833644503438&amp;w=2">post</a>
to the swsusp mailing list at SourceForge for the details of my
solution.  This is all sorted with current SWSUSP and the 2.4.26
kernel -- no need to patch.
</p>


<br>&nbsp;
<p><a name="dvd"></a><b><font size="+2">DVD/CD/CDRW</font></b>
</p><ul>
<li><b>DVD:</b> The main trick here is to build the kernel with the UDF file system (module is fine).  Beyond this, I was using 
the <a href="http://xine.sourceforge.net/">Xine</a> DVD player (needs ALSA) with the DivX codec, but now (14 Aug 02) I also use 
<a href="http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd">Ogle</a> for ease of set-up for things I didn't have working with xine.  
April 2003, I'm an mplayer user today, get all my .deb packages for this from the <a href="http://marillat.free.fr/">Marillat</a> site.<p>  
Note I link /dev/dvd to /dev/scd0.  Check out 
<a href="http://www.condorito.org/Toshiba/#dvd">NB's page</a> for more on ogle and xine players.  I don't yet have the 
TOSLINK to optical minijack adapter to try the S/P DIF (Dolby digital AC-3) output, but the ALSA docs indicate that it isn't
supported for this chipset.  
</p></li><li><b>CDRW:</b> This is just as described in the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html">CD-Writing howto</a>, you need to enable SCSI emulation, SCSI CDROM, and the CDROM 
filesystem(s) in the kernel (modules ok), then append "hdc=ide-scsi" in your <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/lilo.conf">lilo.conf</a>. </li>
</ul>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a name="hdisk"></a><b><font size="+2">Disk Drives</font></b>
</p><ul>
<li><b>floppy disk:</b> this is another USB device, enable "USB Mass Storage support" and "SCSI disk support" in the kernel, then the 
device on my system is /dev/sda0 (see my <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/fstab">/etc/fstab</a> sampling).</li>

<li><b>hard disk:</b> (update 14 Aug 02) enable 'use PCI DMA by default when available' in the kernel, this seems to do away with
the need for either the <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/0hdparm">hdparm script</a> or the lilo options (ide0=dma).  
<!--you'll see the appended "idebus=66" in my <a href="lilo.conf">lilo.conf</a>, but I don't think this actually
does anything.  The real speed-up comes from turning on DMA ASAP during the boot process with the statement "ide0=dma".  I also 
set several features with hdparm in <a href="0hdparm">this file</a>, which goes in my /etc/rc.boot directory (place as appropriate for
your distribution) [<b>not for 2.5</b> kernel]. --> I use and recommend the ext3 filesystem.</li>
</ul>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a name="connect"></a><b><font size="+2">Connecting Up</font></b>
</p><p>Except for the ethernet, this section is all about connecting up to my <a href="http://www.handera.com/">TRGpro</a> (essentially a Palm IIIxe with Compact Flash).
</p><ul>
<li><b>ethernet:</b> I've used both the Intel e100 driver and the EtherExpressPro/100 as modules and compiled 
in to my kernel.  I've switched back to Becker's EtherExpressPro driver as a module, as the e100 'beat detection' seemed to
stop working for me (needed for programs like Debian's <a href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/admin/laptop-net.html">laptop-net</a> 
to respond to plugging in the cable.</li>
<li><b>PCMCIA:</b> The kernel-based PCMCIA now (2.4.20) works for my CF card, so I'm using it with just the support programs from the  <a href="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/">PCMCIA</a> site. </li>
<li><b>IrDA SIR:</b> "X Windows, PCMCIA CF, IrDA SIR -- choose any two (well, almost)."  Try my <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/irda.html">IrDA instructions</a>
to initialise the 82801CAM and SMSC 47N227 chips as a serial COM port
and use with pilot-link for Palm IR file transfers. The 47N227 works
with the 'SMC IrCC' kernel driver. Unfortunately, with the 2.4 kernel
this only seems to work on irq 3 -- and this is needed for the PCMCIA
IDE (ide-cs) support to see the Compact Flash card as a disk (a cheap
adapter allows you to plug CF into PCMCIA slots). I thought that the
2.5 kernel ICH3M code would sort this out, but no; if anyone can tell
me why only irq 3 works for these devices, please drop me a line! <p>
A good work-around is to add 'pre-install ide-cs /etc/init.d/irda stop'
and 'post-remove ide-cs /etc/init.d/irda start' in /etc/modules.conf.
Also, this doesn't play perfectly well with SWSUSP because (I -finally-
figured out) irattach sometimes won't go away on a SIGTERM after a few
hibernation cycles; check my <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/irda">/etc/init.d/irda</a> script for a solution that is working for me.  (even works with Gnome Pilot, check out <a href="http://lyre.mit.edu/%7Epowell/evolution">Adam Powell's site</a> for debs to make the GnomeCal conduit work!)
</p></li><li><b>serial:</b> so I got a used Belkin USB-serial converter (for �12!) and was using the cradle for "quick" pilot-link 
Palm file installs.
I only mention it here because I had to work out that the thing to do is add a script containing "stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 57600" 
to be called as a "post-install" for the belkin_sa module (in other words, have it set the default serial port speed when the 
module is hotplug-loaded on plugging in to the USB; also note it's tty<b>USB</b>0, and doesn't pick up the $PILOTRATE environment
variable).</li>
</ul>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a name="kernel"></a><b><font size="+2">Kernel</font></b>
</p><p>Here's my kernel <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/config">.config</a> file.  Of particular note:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Processor type and features</b>: I build the Toshiba code as a
module, I may keep playing with it; MTRR works, and I enable Local and
IO APIC support even though it doesn't recognise the 82801 (I hacked
the kernel to make it work once, but there
didn't seem to be any benefit -- /proc/interrupts still says XT-PIC for
everything).</li>
<li><b>General setup</b>: Enable PCI support, PCI name database (upgrade to the latest at <a href="http://pciids.sourceforge.net/">http://pciids.sourceforge.net</a>).  Enable support for hot-pluggable devices (USB also uses) and PCMCIA (for me -- see <a href="#connect">connecting</a>) but not PCI Hotplug code.  Power Management support yes.
<ul>
<li><b>ACPI</b>: I build in everything except 'CPU Enumeration (no) only' and 'Toshiba Laptop Extras' (build as module).  Remember 
that I only have these options because I've patched with both the ACPI and John Belmonte Toshiba code (see the <a href="#acpi"> ACPI comments</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li><li><b>MTD, par port, PnP</b>: no.</li>
<li><b>Block devices</b>: don't need Normal PC floppy, do need loopback dev support as module for testing CD images.</li>
<li><b>IDE, ATA ...</b>: IDE CDROM built in, SCSI emulation as a module; Intel PIIXn chipset as it works.  </li>
<li><b>1394</b>: haven't tried it -- send me something to use it with ? :-)</li>
<li><b>IrDA</b>: see my <a href="#connect">connecting</a> comments; I module/enable everything plus drivers IrTTY, IrPORT 
and SMC IrCC. (note there's a new improved smsc-ircc2 out, see the irda page)</li>
<li><b>Input core support</b>: yes, for USB mouse; I enable the Event interface in hopes of cPad play.</li>
<li><b>Character devices</b>: Mice no (not needed for USB mouse), though I stll seem to need the P/S2 mouse module for cPad.
</li><li><b>File systems</b>: yes, you want to use Ext3; it's easy to switch.  ISO9660 plus extensions for CD work, /proc, 
UDF needed for DVDs.</li>
<li><b>Console drivers</b>: VESA frame buffer enabled here.</li>
<li><b>Sound</b>: modularise both 'Sound card support' and 'Intel ICH (i8xx)' if you want to be able to use this or ALSA.</li>
<li><b>USB</b>: Preliminary USB device filesystem; UHCI alternate
driver; USB Mass Storage support for the floppy, full HID support for
the mouse, or use my cPad driver.</li>
<li><b>Bluetooth</b>: haven't tried it -- send me something to talk to ? :-)</li>
</ul>
<p></p><p>You may also want to see my <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/modules.conf">/etc/modules.conf</a> and <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/modules">/etc/modules</a>
files (/etc/modules is Debian specific, I understand Gentoo uses
/etc/modules.autoload, while Suse/RedHat may use entries in
/etc/sysconfig).
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><a name="install"></a><b><font size="+2">Linux Installation</font></b>
</p><p> The easiest way to get an install started was to download the disk images from the Debian distribution
subdirectory dists/woody/main/disks-i386/ into a directory on the Windows XP partition.  Then boot from a DOS
floppy and use the loadlin program (through install.bat) as found in the Debian tools subdirectory.  Drop me a line if
you know a tweek for the XP 'command prompt only' boot mode to give it enough memory to run loadlin.  Check 
your local <a href="http://www.debian.org/misc/README.mirrors">mirror</a> of ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian 
to find these files.  <b>Update:</b> My, how things change.  Now I'd
say the easiest thing is to boot off a knoppix cd and build your hard
drive partition the way you want it for the initial install.

</p><p>The boot device can be selected at power-on or reboot: be holding down the left or right arrow key when
the Toshiba splash screen shows.  This will pause the boot procedure until you hit [enter], booting from the 
selected icon (hdd, cd, fdd, network, PC card ATA device).
<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><a name="wxp"></a><b><font size="+2">Windows XP partition</font></b>
</p><p>The system comes with two formatted VFAT partitions, with Windows XP Home installed on the first.  
I suggest that you don't trash the Windows XP partition for the following reasons:
</p><ul>
<li>This is a '<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/NewPC/legacyIO.htm">legacy free</a>' system, 
thus the definitive Toshiba BIOS manipulation software -- e.g. to set boot device order, or set the owner
string in the subLCD  -- (currently) only runs here.</li>
<li>Might be the only way to get digital sound (S/P DIF) out for the DVD.</li>
<li>Even after <a href="#install">installation</a>, it's useful to have a Linux system that you can get
to with just a DOS boot floppy for those times when you really mess up. :-) </li>
<li>It's the only way to check that the hardware really works, and see how.</li>
<li>If you don't convert to NTFS, the disk space remains available through VFAT. </li>
<li>The Toshiba recovery CD supports (with many "Advanced User Only!" warnings) partition-only recovery and 
recognises Linux partitions.
</li></ul>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a name="likes"></a><b><font size="+2">Likes</font></b>
</p><p>It works as well (almost!) as I had hoped, and lived up to the <a href="http://www.janerob.com/rob/ts5100/laptop_choices.html">expectations</a>
 I'd developed from researching on the net.  Certainly all of the "core" Linux functionality is working.
</p><ul>
<li>The case build is brilliant.  Everything works, feels solid, no creaks, the doors don't pop off or look 
like they will.</li>
<li>The UXGA display is everything I'd hoped for.  There are no dead pixels, 
</li><li>It feels fast.</li>
<li>The recovery CD is as Linux friendly as would be reasonably expected.</li>
<li>Having used it over 3 months now, the keyboard feels good and is "easy to type fast on".  
</li></ul>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a name="dislikes"></a><b><font size="+2">Dislikes</font></b>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>It appears that Toshiba declined to supply the wires or external connectors for hardware that I believe
exists internally:
<ul>
<li>no S-Video (S-VHS) out -- I think it loses the "desktop replacement" label here for not supplying full 
quality DVD playback.  <b>Update:</b> I've found a cable which brings
out an S-video connector from the same plug, but haven't tried it yet...
</li><li>the SMSC 47N227 supplying the IR also has (by the <a href="http://www.smsc.com/main/datasheet.html">documentation</a>) 
serial, parallel and FDC ports -- "legacy free" indeed...</li>
</ul>
I would have provided a proprietary external connector and "extra ports" accessory, but I can understand the
economic argument that serial and parallel ports are available as a USB dongle for Windows users, and perhaps a videophile
1394 solution as well.  I would prefer to have a standard serial port and S-Video output with a converter down to 
composite.</li>
<li>It is just slightly warmer than I'd prefer when using it for 2-3 hours
on my lap (could be <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/28245.html"> worse</a>).  The CPU temperature while editing this has ranged from 60-70 C 
(fan comes on at 70).
</li><li>There appears to be no interface available (even under Windows) to <i>really</i>
save battery power when off. Specifically
the ethernet active LED, the PC-off CD player facility (it can be
locked off manually after shutdown), and the small
LCD (trivial consumption) all stay on. The upshot is that the "shelf
life" to a completely dead battery when turned off seems short (2-3
days if I recall correctly). </li>
<li>I would prefer to have direct BIOS access; although rarely accessed, it would make some things easier.
An OS-neutral solution would be to publicly document the API available for setting up the PC hardware.</li>

Yes, I'm still very happy with it and use it as a desktop replacement day-in and day-out.  The only problems have been 
that the display has developed some 'washed out pixels' around the top and right edges, and at some point I seem to have 
cleaned the screen too vigorously and made a shiny spot near the middle.  The washed out pixel problem is  very subtle and 
I can only really detect it when KDE flashes a grey screen before putting up it's normal background -- I tried to find a 
Windows background that would make it show up when I had it in the shop once (trashed the cPad while experimenting :-), but 
concluded that the Toshiba techs are trained to be unable to perceive display problems...  The shiny spot is only noticeable 
when it is off and sometimes when I am working at the console; perhaps there is a layer of plastic that I could replace 
protecting the LCD to fix this, but the only Toshiba repair facility on this continent is in South Africa (I bought my 
laptop in London, then moved to Nigeria -- so much for that 3 year warranty!).
</p><p>
I don't use it on my lap anymore so the heat isn't a problem, and there are no problems with the case at all.
</p><p>
Wow, one week short of one year since I bought it and I have everything working to my satisfaction!  Good thing I Haven't
needed to get the winmodem working :-).
</p><p>
<b>Year 2 Update:</b> Still going strong, especially with the new
screen...  And I <em>do</em> have the winmodem working now, too....
</p><p>
<b>Year 4+ Update:</b> I lost a year of use due to the video card
problem and moved completely back to a desktop in that time.  The 5100
is still my work laptop though, and holding up very well.  I got one
