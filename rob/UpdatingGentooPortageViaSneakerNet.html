I like Gentoo, but it really wants a broadband internet
connection.&nbsp; If your install doesn't have that luxury, but you
have access to a machine that does, here's a way to get the files you
need to update with.&nbsp; If you don't want the'world' of updates,
work with the second form of the <span style="font-style: italic;">emerge</span>
command below.<br>
<br>
<br>
Go to <a href="http://gentoo.osuosl.org/snapshots">http://gentoo.osuosl.org/snapshots</a>
and get portage-latest.tar.bz2 (21mb at time of this writing - so yes,
you likely need two trips to the internet connection)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">tar xjf portage-latest.tar.bz2</span>
from /usr, so it overwrites /usr/portage.&nbsp; This will not delete
files like 'emerge sync' does, so when you go to build you may find
'security violation' complaints about files in ebuild directories not
in the manifest.&nbsp; Note that, with a 33.6 connection a few hours
after getting the portage-latest file, an 'emerge sync' took (only) 18
minutes including the time to update the portage cache.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge -puDv world</span> or whatever
target you like, fix any blockages reported and make note of any 'F'
ebuilds which you will have to download manually.&nbsp; Take note of
the "Total size of downloads: " line at the end so you are
prepared.&nbsp; If you have a dialup connection and it says it will
update portage, might as well do this now as it is not too big.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge -puDf world 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;
/dev/null | sed -e 's/ /\n/g' &gt; toget.lst</span> to generate the
list of files to download<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge -pf <span
 style="font-style: italic;">package</span> 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; /dev/null
| sed -e 's/ /\n/g' &gt;&gt; toget.lst</span> to add any additional <span
 style="font-style: italic;">package</span>s you'll want to install<br>
<br>
put <span style="font-weight: bold;">toget.lst</span> on a portable
storage device (usb hard drive, flash memory, whatever your plan is),
and take it to your internet connection.&nbsp; You may wish to add <a
 href="http://xoomer.virgilio.it/hherold/">Heiko Herold's windows wget</a>
if you're stuck on the dark side.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">wget -i toget.lst -nc -nd</span> in
the dir you want the files to appear should do it from there.&nbsp; The
options are :&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">-i</span> : read the urls from
the specified file</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">-nc</span> :&nbsp; no-clobber;
the toget.lst file lists many mirrors for most files to download, this
way it will ignore them if it has the file already.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">problem:</span>&nbsp; if a download breaks
part way through, it won't be detected, and the file will not be
completed.&nbsp; the alternative is to use -N, but this requires
getting a file listing from each ftp mirror site (about 1.5mb for
portage/distfiles).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">-nd</span> : no directory
structure - otherwise it will create full dir trees for each mirror
site, leading to redundant file downloads and a headache finding all
the target files on the leaves.</li>
</ul>
Finally, copy the downloaded files from your storage device to
/usr/portage/distfiles and run the <span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge
-uD world</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge <span
 style="font-style: italic;">package</span></span> command as needed.<br>
