despite the amazing coolness of having unix(tm) - linux - in the palm
ouf your hand, I've pretty much given up using my zaurus.  its heavy,
big, and the superior open source roms still aren't that stable or
well supported.  I bought a palm z22 (zire) off ebay with a palm soft
rubber case and find it very satisfactory.
<p>
two points on reviews I found of the z22 before I bought:
<ul>
<li>
some reviews describe the z22/zire as an appropriate pda for someone just
starting out, new to pdas.  I've programmed the casio zoomer, sharp pc-1600,
various palm iii versions and the zaurus; I bought and use the z22
because it is simple and just does what I need a pda for (and it still
runs OnboardC)
</li>
<li>
some reviews complain that the z22/zire case feels cheap and
'plasticky'; maybe so, but with the palm rubber glove-like case that
came with mine it feels and is as robust as I need (and I'm pretty
hard on things).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
having made the decision to switch back to palm, the remaining issue
was getting the personal data converted over.  the addresses weren't
too bad, though can't remember how I did it, but for the password
keyring (one of my biggest uses for a pda) I had to write some code.
<a href="http://www.scrypt.net/~celer/kweb/">keyring</a> for the
zaurus held all my data and can export everything to a plain text xml
file, while <a href="http://gnukeyring.sourceforge.net/">keyring</a>
for palm os was where I wanted to get it to.  <a
href="http://www.jpilot.org/index.html">jpilot</a> provides an open
source conduit for palm os keyring, so that's where I started.  

<p>
here is my modified <a href="keyring.c">keyring.c</a> file. swap it
for jpilot's keyring.c to get a keyring import conduit that can read
your zaurus keyring xml file.  you will no doubt find that all the
fields do not match up perfectly, but it goes a lot faster than doing
it entirely by hand.
<p>
I hope you find this useful.
