title: "Today I ... free personal logger for iOS and MacOS"
date: 2020-06-23

Summary:
--------
I wrote a simple app for capturing sentences with time, date and
weather on iOS using iOS Shortcuts, and just the text and timestamp on
MacOS using a bash script.  The journal lives in iCloud, so it stays
synchronised between devices.  Here it is:

For iOS, grab the '[Local Info Strings](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8538b693ca1c4ba7910f278b85fe867d)' and '[todayi](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5efbcce549ea4ab9ad0076fd28aa8f31)'
Shortcuts and [learn how to add them to your iPhone or iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/apdfeb05586f/ios).

For MacOS, see the Bash script and notes below.

In both cases, my recommendation is to look at my work and roll your own!

Background:
-----------
I've long had a personal interest in tracking, personal logging and/or
journalling.  This was part of my reason for writing
[rTracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rtracker-track-it-your-way/id486541371),
but I've wanted something more general.  The issue is that events
happen which are notable on the day - "noticed a funny cough this
morning" - but entirely random (thus outside of rTracker's remit) and
lost without some system of making a note for it.  The real problem is
that these details only become important later, and you can't tell in
advance what you should make a note of.

To approach this I started using [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/), then got fed up with it when
they did a paid upgrade (and I didn't want to pay after I missed the
discount window), while at the same
time something happened and I lost access to my journal.
Their support sorted me out so I got my data back, but I concluded
that this wasn't where I wanted to be keeping the ongoing record of my
life.

Later I found [Journey](https://2appstudio.com/journey/), and was so pleased with it that I'm a fully paid
up lifetime user for both the iOS and MacOS versions.  I particularly
liked their 'open data' thinking and that it could import my previous
Day One entries, and I still use the iOS
version preferentially because it adds location and weather data to my
entries.  Recently I've felt they are not interested in developing
Journey further, but that's based on poor responses to my feature
requests and no doubt they have other things to do.

The problem with both of these is that they don't actually target my
use case.  Really a journal for me - thanks to my High School English
classes - is a little essay about something I'm feeling or thinking
about at the moment, and I don't actually have the time or energy to do
this everyday.  As a result I don't end up logging the minutiae that
goes by - like when we bought or finished that last 1/2 ton of firewood, or had
the drains cleared of roots - and that means I can't search for it
later to understand and learn from my own history.

Doing it (MacOS command line utility):
---------
So initially I thought up a short [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script that just takes
everything after the executable name and appends it to a text file.
The name is 'todayi':

~~~~~~~~
#!/usr/local/bin/bash
FIL=~/iCloudW/todayi.txt
if [ $# -gt 0 ]
then
   DSTR="$(/bin/date "+%d/%m/%Y, %H:%M")"
   echo ${DSTR} $@ >>$FIL 
else
   tail $FIL
fi
~~~~~~~~
{: .language-bash}

Type it without any additional text and it prints out the last few
lines for your pleasure.  If you copy this for your own use, do note that
my bash is in /usr/local/bin because I use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installation,
and ~/iCloudW is a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to the directory
~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~is~workflow~my~workflows/Documents 
because nobody wants to type that out but it sure is nice to find the
stuff.  That directory link and the date format evolved out of what I
later needed to do to have a matching solution on my iPhone.

Synchronising between iPhone and Mac is the easy part, as both have
access to documents stored in iCloud.  The next step was finding
[Kodex](https://kodex.app/), a brilliant little text editor for iOS that immediately got a
place on my first page of apps.  This left [getting the time/datestamp at least on to the clipboard](https://domainwebcenter.com/iphone-ios-13-shortcut-automation-to-insert-date-time-stamp-into-notes/),
and that's how I initially discovered [iOS Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios). 

Doing it (iOS shortcuts):
-------------------------
I leave it as an exercise to the reader to follow down [that](https://www.imore.com/all-shortcuts-actions-apple-apps) [rabbit](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/ios-13-siri-shortcuts-library/)
[hole](https://sharecuts.app/) on their own, and simply present my own answer here.  I broke it
into two parts when I found the weather API has all the annotations I
wanted (time, location and weather) - so **Local Info Strings** is a 'subroutine', while
the main app called **todayi** gets the text from Siri and appends it all to the file:

Usage and Conclusion:
---------------------
To use, start Siri and say "Today I" and wait.  Siri will ask 'What text?', then press the Siri button and say what you like.

I added the Air Quality and other weather data because I move around a lot, and our next posting will be more polluted than our current one.  There's still the problem that Siri dictated text may not always be perfect, but for that I just fix the entry with [Kodex](https://kodex.app/) - the todayi.txt file is under *Shortcuts* in the iOS **Files** app and your iCloud folder, or you can check the note on the directory link above fore the Bash script to find it on your Mac.

Enjoy!
