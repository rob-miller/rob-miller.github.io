<div class="blurb">
  <p>I'm a "trailing spouse", a career choice I highly recommend - especially if you are a self-starting scientist geek
    who likes to travel
    like me.</p>
  <p>My brilliant wife works for the <a
      href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-development-office">FCDO</a>,
    and with her I've lived in London, Durban, Cape Town, Abuja, Lusaka, Dar es Salaam and now Georgetown, Guyana.
    Before meeting her I lived in (and
    was old enough to remember) Den Hague, Stuttgart, Camp Zama (Japan), Kapaa (Hawaii), Moscow (Idaho!), Olympia,
    Seattle, Everett and Pullman (Washington),
    Washington, D.C., Buenos Aires, and Grenoble (France). Did I mention I like to travel?</p>
  <p>My field of interest is bioinformatics, primarily protein structure prediction. My main hobby is FDM 3D printing,
    which I also use for
    protein structures so that I can claim to be working more often. I also enjoy scuba diving, running, photography and
    coding in general.</p>
  <p>We have one lovely, amazing daughter; we used to have two. That loss changed my values substantially.</p>
