<div class="blurb">
	<p>I'm a "trailing spouse", a career choice I highly recommend - especially if you are a self-starting scientist geek who likes to travel 
  like me.</p>
  <p>My brilliant wife works for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development#content">DFID</a>, 
  and with her I've lived in London, Durban, Cape Town, Abuja, Lusaka, Dar es Salaam and soon New Delhi.  Before meeting her I lived in (and 
  was old enough to remember) Den Hague, Stuttgart, Camp Zama (Japan), Kapaa (Hawaii), Moscow (Idaho!), Seattle, Everett and Pullman (Washington), 
  Buenos Aires, and Grenoble (France).  Did I mention I like to travel?</p>
  <p>My field of interest is bioinformatics, primarily protein structure prediction.  My main hobby is FDM 3D printing, which I also use for
  protein structures so that I can claim to be working more often.  I also enjoy scuba diving, running, photography and coding in general.</p>
  <p>We have one lovely, amazing daughter; we used to have two.  That loss changed my values substantially.</p>
